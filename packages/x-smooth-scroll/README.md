# @repo/x-smooth-scroll

Experimental package for trying to create package like [lenis](https://github.com/darkroomengineering/lenis).

Conclusion: just use [lenis](https://github.com/darkroomengineering/lenis) instead, or any smooth scrolling library like [locomotive-scroll](https://github.com/locomotivemtl/locomotive-scroll/tree/v5-beta), etc.
